    - This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to Python data types, covering fundamental concepts, syntax, and examples for each data type. Whether you're a beginner learning Python or an experienced developer looking for a quick reference, this repository is designed to enhance your understanding of data handling in Python programming.
# Contents:
  ## 1.Introduction to Data Types:
  - Overview of data types in Python.
  - Importance of data types in programming.
    ## 2.Numeric Data Types:
     - ### Integers ('int'):
         - Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimal points. They are used to represent values like counts, indices, or any whole number quantity.
         - Syntax: 'x = 10'
         - Example:
           ```python
           age = 25
           ```
     - ### Floating-point Numbers ('float'):
         - Floating-point numbers are numbers with decimal points or exponential notation. They are used to represent real numbers and are suitable for calculations involving fractions or decimal values.
         - Syntax: 'y = 3.14'
         - Example:
           ```python
           pi = 3.14159
           ```
    ## 3. Textual Data Type:
     - ### Strings ('str'):
        - Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. They are used to represent text or any sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols.
         - Syntax: 'name = \John Doe\'
         - Example: 
           ```python
           message = 'Hello, World!'
           ```
    ## 4.Sequence Data Types:
     - ### Lists ('list'):
         -  Lists are ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets '[]'. They can contain elements of different data types and allow for mutable operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.
         - Syntax: 'my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']'
         - Example: 
           ```python
           numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
           ```
     - ### Tuples ('tuple'):
         - Tuples are ordered collections of items enclosed in parentheses '()'. They are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once defined.
         - Syntax: 'my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')'
         - Example: 
           ```python
           coordinates = (10, 20)
           ```
    ## 5.Mapping Data Type:
     - ### Dictionaries ('dict'):
         - Dictionaries are key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces '{}'. They are used to store data in a structured format, where each value is accessed by its corresponding key.
         - Syntax: 'my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}'
         - Example:
           ```python
           student_info = {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 'A', 'age': 25}
           ```
    ## 6.Boolean Data Type:
     - ### Booleans ('bool'):
         - Booleans represent truth values True or False. They are used in conditions, comparisons, and logical operations to determine the flow of program execution.
         - Syntax: 'is_active = True'
         - Example: 
           ```python
           is_valid = False
           ```
