- Comparison operators in Python are used to compare values and return 'True' or 'False' based on the comparison result. These operators are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of your program based on conditions.
    Comparison operators compare the values of operands.
    
    ## 1. Equal to (==)
    The equal to operator ('==') checks if two values are equal.
    
    ### Syntax:
    `operand1 == operand2`
    
    ### Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 5
    result = x == y  # False
    ```
    
    ## 2. Not equal to (!=)
    The not equal to operator ('!=') checks if two values are not equal.
    
    ### Syntax:
    `operand1 != operand2`
    
    ### Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 5
    result = x != y  # True
    ```
    
    ## 3. Greater than (>)
    The greater than operator ('>') checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    
    ### Syntax:
    `operand1 > operand2`
    
    ### Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 5
    result = x > y  # True
    ```
    
    ## 4. Less than (<)
    The less than operator ('<') checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
    
    ### Syntax:
    `operand1 < operand2`
    
    ### Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 5
    result = x < y  # False
    ```
    
    ## 5. Greater than or equal to (>=)
    The greater than or equal to operator (>=) checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
    
    ### Syntax:
    `operand1 >= operand2`
    
    ### Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 5
    result = x >= y  # True
    ```
    
    ## 6. Less than or equal to (<=)
    The less than or equal to operator (<=) checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
    
    ### Syntax:
    `operand1 <= operand2`
    
    ### Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 5
    result = x <= y  # False
    ```
    
# Conclusion
- Understanding and using comparison operators in Python allows you to make decisions based on conditions in your code. These operators are fundamental for creating logical flows and implementing control structures in your programs.
