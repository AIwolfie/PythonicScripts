- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform arithmetic or logical operations along with assignment.
    
    - ## 1. Assignment ('=')
       The assignment operator ('=') assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
    
        ### Syntax:
          \variable = expression\
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
        x = 10  # Assigns the value 10 to variable x
         ```
    
    - ## 2. Addition Assignment ('+=')
       The addition assignment operator ('+=') adds the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
    
        ### Syntax:
          \variable += expression\
          #(Equivalent to 'variable = variable + expression')
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
        x = 5
        x += 3  # Adds 3 to x (x is now 8)
         ```
    
    - ## 3. Subtraction Assignment ('-=')
       The subtraction assignment operator ('-=') subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the variable on the left-hand side.
        ### Syntax:
          \variable -= expression\
          #(Equivalent to variable = variable - expression)
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
         x = 10
         x -= 4  # Subtracts 4 from x (x is now 6)
         ``` 
    
    - ## 4. Multiplication Assignment ('*=')
       The multiplication assignment operator ('*=') multiplies the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
        ### Syntax:
          \variable *= expression\
          #(Equivalent to variable = variable * expression)
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
         x = 3
         x *= 2  # Multiplies x by 2 (x is now 6)
         ``` 
    
    - ## 5. Division Assignment ('/=')
       The division assignment operator ('/=') divides the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
        ### Syntax:
          \variable /= expression\
          #(Equivalent to variable = variable / expression)
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
         x = 10
         x /= 5  # Divides x by 5 (x is now 2.0)
         ``` 
    
    - ## 6. Modulus Assignment ('%=')
       The modulus assignment operator ('%=') assigns the remainder of the division of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
        ### Syntax:
          \variable %= expression\
          # (Equivalent to variable = variable % expression))
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
         x = 10
         x %= 3  # Assigns the remainder of x divided by 3 to x (x is now 1)
         ``` 
    
    - ## 7. Floor Division Assignment ('//=')
       The floor division assignment operator ('//=') assigns the result of the floor division of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
        ### Syntax:
          \variable //= expression\
          #(Equivalent to variable = variable // expression)
    
        ### Example:
         ```bash
         x = 10
         x //= 3  # Assigns the floor division result of x divided by 3 to x (x is now 3)
         ``` 
    
# Conclusion
- Assignment operators in Python are powerful tools for assigning values to variables and performing operations simultaneously. Understanding and using these operators efficiently can streamline your code and improve readability.
