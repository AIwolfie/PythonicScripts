- In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. An operand is a value or variable on which an operation is performed. Python supports various types of operators, each serving different purposes like arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, assignment operations, etc.
    
    # Types of Operators
    - ### 1.Arithmetic Operators:
        Used for mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
    
    - ### 2.Comparison (Relational) Operators: 
        Used to compare values and return True or False based on the comparison result.
    
    - ### 3.Logical Operators:
        Used to combine multiple conditions and return True or False based on the logical evaluation.
    
    - ### 4.Assignment Operators: 
        Used to assign values to variables.
    
    - ### 5. Bitwise Operators:
        Used to perform bitwise operations on integers.
    
    - ### 6. Membership Operators:
        Used to test if a value or variable is present in a sequence.
    
    - ### 7. Identity Operators: 
        Used to compare the memory location of two objects.
    
  # Key Concepts
    - ### Operand: 
        A value or variable on which an operation is performed.
    
    - ### Operator: 
        A special symbol or keyword that performs a specific operation.
    
    - ### Expression:
        A combination of operands and operators that evaluates to a value.
    
    - ### Assignment: 
        Storing a value in a variable using an assignment operator.
    
  # Why Operators Matter
    Understanding operators is crucial for writing efficient and effective code. They allow you to perform calculations, make decisions, manipulate data structures, and control program flow. Whether you're performing basic arithmetic or complex logical operations, knowing how to use operators correctly is essential for programming in Python.
    
  # How to Use This Guide
    Each type of operator will be covered in separate files within this repository. Dive into each file to explore the syntax, examples, and explanations of that specific type of operator. Practice with code examples and experiment to solidify your understanding of Python operators.
