- Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations in Python. They include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and floor division.
    
    Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations.
    
    - ## Addition Operator (+)
       The addition operator ('+') is used to add two numbers.
    
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 + operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
           a = 10
           b = 5
           result_add = a + b  # Result: 15
         ```
    
    - ## Subtraction Operator (-)
       The subtraction operator ('-') is used to subtract one number from another.
    
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 - operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
          a = 10
          b = 5
          result_sub = a - b  # Result: 5
         ```
    
    - ## Multiplication Operator (*)
       The multiplication operator ('*') is used to multiply two numbers.
    
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 * operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
          a = 10
          b = 5
          result_mul = a * b  # Result: 50
         ``` 
    
    - ## Division Operator (/)
       The division operator ('/') is used to divide one number by another. It performs float division, meaning it returns a floating-point number.
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 / operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
          a = 10
          b = 5
          result_div = a / b  # Result: 2.0
         ``` 
    
    - ## Floor Division Operator (//)
       The floor division operator ('//') is used to perform integer division. It returns the quotient without the decimal part.
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 // operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
          a = 10
          b = 5
          result_floor_div = a // b  # Result: 2
         ``` 
    
    - ## Modulus Operator (%)
       The modulus operator ('%') is used to get the remainder of a division operation.
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 % operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
          a = 10
          b = 5
          result_mod = a % b  # Result: 0
         ```
    
    - ## Exponentiation Operator (**)
       The exponentiation operator ('**') is used to raise a number to the power of another number.
        ### Syntax:
          operand1 ** operand2
        ### Example:
         ```bash
          base = 2
          exponent = 3
          result_exp = base ** exponent  # Result: 2 ** 3 = 8
         ```
