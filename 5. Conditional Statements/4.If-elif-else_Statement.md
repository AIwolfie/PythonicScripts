    "# If-elif-else Statement\n",

    "The 'if-elif-else' statement is a powerful tool in Python for handling multiple conditions in a structured manner. It allows you to test multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on the evaluation of these conditions. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here's the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # code block to execute if condition1 is true\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # code block to execute if condition2 is true\n",
    "elif condition3:\n",
    "    # code block to execute if condition3 is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block to execute if all conditions are false\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- ### if condition1:\n",
    "    This is the primary condition that is checked first. If 'condition1' evaluates to 'True', the corresponding code block is executed, and the rest of the 'elif' and 'else' blocks are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### elif condition2:\n",
    "    If 'condition1' is 'False', then 'condition2' is checked. If 'condition2' is 'True', the corresponding code block is executed. This chain continues with additional 'elif' conditions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### else:\n",
    "    This block is executed only if none of the preceding conditions ('if' and 'elif') are 'True'. It provides a default code block to execute when no other conditions match.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points:\n",
    "- ### Mutually Exclusive Conditions:\n",
    "    Each 'if' and 'elif' condition is evaluated sequentially. Once a condition is 'True', the corresponding code block is executed, and the rest of the 'elif' and 'else' blocks are skipped. This means that only one code block within an 'if-elif-else' structure is executed.\n",
    "- ### Order of Conditions: \n",
    "    The order of conditions in an 'if-elif-else' statement is crucial. Conditions should be arranged from the most specific to the most general. This ensures that the correct code block is executed based on the priority of conditions.\n",
    "- ### Multiple Elif Blocks: \n",
    "    You can have multiple 'elif' blocks to test additional conditions. This allows for complex decision-making based on different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    grade = 'A'\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    grade = 'B'\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    grade = 'C'\n",
    "elif score >= 60:\n",
    "    grade = 'D'\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    grade = 'F'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Your grade is:\", grade)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- ### Explanation: \n",
    "    - If 'score' is '85', it falls between '80' and '90', so the condition 'score >= 80' is 'True'. Therefore, the grade assigned is 'B', and the output will be \"Your grade is: B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The if-elif-else statement is invaluable for decision-making in Python programs, allowing you to handle diverse scenarios and provide appropriate responses based on conditions."
