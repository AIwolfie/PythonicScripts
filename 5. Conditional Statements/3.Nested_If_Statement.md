    "![Logo](https://imgs.search.brave.com/AP1N1ZZdMtFyaK4hAk2ZcpZhQkdsEZQSKrfQa6v5ymc/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS5nZWVrc2Zvcmdl/ZWtzLm9yZy93cC1j/b250ZW50L3VwbG9h/ZHMvbmVzdGVkLWlm/LmpwZw)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A nested if statement is a structure in Python that allows you to include one or more if statements inside another if statement. This creates a hierarchy of conditions where the inner if statements are evaluated only if the outer if statement's condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here's the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # code block for condition1\n",
    "    if condition2:\n",
    "       # code block for condition2\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "       # code block for condition2 false\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block for condition1 false\n",
    "```\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "  - ### Outer If Statement: \n",
    "    The outer if statement checks a primary condition. If this condition is true, the code inside its block is executed.\n",
    "  - ### Inner If Statement: \n",
    "    If the outer if statement's condition is true, the inner if statement is evaluated. This inner condition can further refine the decision-making process based on a secondary condition.\n",
    "  - ### Else Statements: \n",
    "    Both the outer and inner if statements can have corresponding else blocks, which execute when their respective conditions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "    if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is even\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"x is odd\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ### Explanation: \n",
    "      - The outer if statement checks if 'x' is greater than '5', which is true ('10 > 5'), so it prints \"x is greater than 5\".\n",
    "      - The inner if statement inside the true branch of the outer if checks if 'x' is even ('10 % 2 == 0 is true'), so it prints \"x is even\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "- Nested if statements are useful when you have complex decision-making scenarios that require multiple levels of conditions. For example, in a program dealing with different user roles, you might use nested if statements to check both the user's authentication status and their specific role permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The 'if-else' statement is a foundational concept in programming, providing a way to execute different blocks of code based on conditions. It's essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs that adapt to different situations, making your code more robust and versatile."
